# High-Level Reference Model (Python)

This directory provides a floating-point reference implementation of the MODWT-based audio denoising algorithm in Python. It serves as a high-level model for validation and comparison against the bit-exact C and VHDL implementations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

*(Typical dependencies include `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pywt`.)*

## Usage

To run the reference model, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, `main.py` will:

1. Load an input `.wav` file (configured in the script or via command-line arguments).
2. Apply the MODWT denoising algorithm.
3. Save the denoised output and generate diagnostic plots.

## Module Overview

* `modwt_denoising.py`
  Contains the core implementation of the MODWT denoising algorithm, including wavelet decomposition, thresholding, and reconstruction steps.

* `main.py`
  Orchestrates I/O, calls functions from `modwt_denoising.py`, and handles result saving and plotting.
