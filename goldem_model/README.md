# MODWT FPGA Denoising

This project provides a hardware implementation of audio denoising using wavelets (MODWT) on FPGA. The repository includes bit-exact C models, high-level Python references, and synthesizable VHDL modules for use in real-time or offline audio processing systems.

## Build Instructions

To compile the C-based golden model, run:

```bash
bash build.sh
````

The executable will be generated at:

```
bin/modwt
```

This binary processes input `.wav` files and outputs the denoised signal for validation and comparison.

## Future Work

* **Python Integration**: Automate simulation runs, plotting, and statistical analysis via Python scripting.
* **Windowed Processing**: Implement ping-pong buffer-based processing to handle long-duration signals (e.g., several minutes of audio) in limited-memory environments.
* **DWT Golden Model**: Extend the bit-exact reference implementation to support DWT in addition to MODWT.
